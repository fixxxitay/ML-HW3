        It may very well be that “one size doesn’t fit all”,
        namely that modeling differently each of the
        tasks provides better results. Check this paradigm -

        1. Use a different modeling procedure (train and test)
           for each of the three mandatory prediction tasks
        2. Compare results with the results obtained using the one model approach
            2.1 Note that “Better results” are not merely a higher accuracy,
                but also simpler models (why is it important?), stable predictions, etc.
